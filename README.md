# PHP Phonebook Mini-Framework

This project is a simple and secure **phonebook web application** built entirely in **pure PHP** using a custom mini-framework developed from scratch.

It allows users to:

- Add new contacts
- Search contacts in real-time
- Delete contacts securely with CSRF protection
- All implemented within a basic routing and middleware infrastructure



## Features

- Custom routing system (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, etc.)
- Global & route-specific middleware support
- CSRF token generation and validation
- Basic session management
- XSS-safe form inputs
- Minimal clean UI with Bootstrap
